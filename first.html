      <h2>The Purpose of the Event</h2>
      <p> The Hour of Code is at its core not about learning a brand new skill in just one hour. One hour is not enough to learn how to code. It's about increasing access to computer science by breaking stereotypes and opening doors. Somebody may learn programming concepts like loops, conditionals, or basic debugging through the Hour of Code. But a much more important goal is for students and teachers to learn that computer science is fun â€” you can start at any age, in any classroom, even if you do not have a computer. </p>

      <h3>At a high level, after just one Hour of Code:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>More students reported liking computer science</li>
        <li>More students reported feeling they are able to learn computer science, and</li>
        <li>More students reported feeling they are better at computer science than their peers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Adventure</h2>
      <h3>ADA University Part</h3>
      <p>During this part we represented our university and informed the students about the following topics:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Introduction</li>
        <li>ADA with numbers</li>
        <li>Success stories</li>
        <li>How to be an ADAli</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Hour of Code Part</h3>
      <p>We as a group of 4 SITE student, had a very informative representation about Computer Science to the 4-year graders of Baku Eureka High School. Our main purpose was to inform children about the computers, their working principles, components and at the last to learn the basics of algorithms and programming. We taught pupils how to work with Code.org and write a successful code. Fortunately, all students had a great willingness to the computers and general coding. We also got inspired when we saw the motivated students. At the end of the practice, all of them had earned their own online certificate and it was impressive.</p>
